# SquareWorld
This project was made by Nanne & Wouter for the course Visual computing project at the Eindhoven University of Technology for the master Computer science and engineering.
The goal of the project was to create a procedural city generator on any platform, and we chose Minecraft.

The project contains a plugin SquareWorld.jar which can be loaded in any Minecraft Spigot server 1.8.9 and up. Once loaded it will generate cities in the world based in different parameters and sizes. The cities can also be generated manually with the command /createcity <width> <height> <seed> <intersections> <prunedistance> <roadlatchdistance> <minblockwidth> <houses true|false>

This project is no longer maintained, the project report will be added later on.
